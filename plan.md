# Overall Objective:

Create a graphical user interface with PyQt

 Demonstrate various image processing techniques, including grayscale transformation, histogram equalization, and filtering using OpenCV. 
 
 Visualize convolution operations, where users can set convolution kernel parameters, stride, etc., and the kernel is gradually calculated and displayed until a complete result is generated. 
 
 Show a demo of image recognition, such as license plate detection, with breakpoints set at key points to wait for user input to make the image recognition process clearer.

# Stage Objective: 
The project will be completed in 12 weeks.

## Week 1: 
Analyze product requirements, determine software functionality and expected performance. 

Write software requirements specification document. 

The software requirements specification document includes: 

- positioning and objectives
- related definitions
- project background
- requirement overview
- system structure
- functional overview
- image enhancement method visualization module
- image geometric transformation module
- convolution network visualization module
- and image recognition display module
- performance requirements
- supported platforms
- etc.

## Week 2: 
Familiarize team members with the basic usage of GitHub, PyQt, and necessary image processing techniques, including
- Git basic commands
- Python syntax
- PyQt visual development basics
- image enhancement algorithms (smoothing, sharpening, contrast, brightness, grayscale adjustment, histogram equalization, filtering, etc.)
- image geometric transformation algorithms (translation, scaling, horizontal mirroring, vertical mirroring, transposition, cropping, rotation, etc.)
- convolution operations
- image recognition neural networks.

## Week 3: 
Write small test demos on respective IDEs, configure the development environment, run various atomic operations smoothly, and test project feasibility. 

Discuss difficulties within the group and delegate some tasks to teammates if necessary. 

Make appropriate modifications after discussing any unreasonable requirements analysis and project arrangements in the initial stage.

 implement the classic 3x3 convolution kernel display:
 
 - 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 
 - 1 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 1 
 - 0 -1 0 -1 4 -1 0 -1 0 
 - -1 -1 -1 -1 8 -1 -1 -1 -1
